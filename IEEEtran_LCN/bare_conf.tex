% *** Authors should verify (and, if needed, correct) their LaTeX system  ***
% *** with the testflow diagnostic prior to trusting their LaTeX platform ***

% The testflow support page is at:
% http://www.michaelshell.org/tex/testflow/



% Note that the a4paper option is mainly intended so that authors in
% countries using A4 can easily print to A4 and see how their papers will
% look in print - the typesetting of the document will not typically be
% affected with changes in paper size (but the bottom and side margins will).
% Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify correct handling of
% both paper sizes by the user's LaTeX system.
%
% Also note that the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", option
% should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be displayed in
% draft mode.
%
\documentclass[conference]{IEEEtran}
% Add the compsoc option for Computer Society conferences.
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[conference]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{color}
\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
 \ifpdf
   \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
   \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.png,.jpg,.jpeg,.mps}
   \usepackage{pgf}
   \usepackage{tikz}
 \else
   \usepackage{graphicx}
   \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps,.bmp}
   \DeclareGraphicsRule{.emf}{bmp}{}{}% declare EMF filename extension
   \DeclareGraphicsRule{.png}{bmp}{}{}% declare PNG filename extension
   \usepackage{pgf}
   \usepackage{tikz}
   \usepackage{pstricks}
   % dvi code
 \fi
 \usepackage{epic,bez123}
 \usepackage{floatflt}% package for floatingfigure environment
 \usepackage{wrapfig}% package for wrapfigure environment
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.
\usepackage{verbatimbox}





% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\begin{abstract}
Identifying applications are critical for a broad range of network related activities like bandwidth usage, security etc. Earlier, applications are identified based on port numbers, which proved to be not accurate anymore; based of payload signatures, which is proved to be accurate but has been limited in the real world implementation because of privacy concerns; based on flow statistics, which uses machine learning algorithms to find the patterns in the flow statistics and use it in classification, which has been widely used for many classification problems.  In this research, we explore the importance of the attributes or a combination of flow attributes which can classify applications effectively. The idea is to combine clustering and using combinations of flow attributes and we measure accuracy of each combination. We are currently evaluating our model with real-world traffic traces indicating effectiveness of the selective attributes is effective than using the whole set of attributes.
\end{abstract}
% IEEEtran.cls defaults to using nonbold math in the Abstract.
% This preserves the distinction between vectors and scalars. However,
% if the conference you are submitting to favors bold math in the abstract,

% of the abstract to achieve this. Many IEEE journals/conferences frown on
% math in the abstract anyway.

\section{Introduction}
Recently, there has been a lot of emphasis on using flow statistics with combination of Machine learning algorithms to determine network based applications. Accurately identifying network based application is of major interest for ISP. Which lets providing Quality based Service(limiting usage of bandwidth by unnecessary applications). 

 In this paper, we proposed a new technique which studies the relevance of flow statistics or combination of them to give us better classification. We compared our technique with previously published work. As with most machine learning algorithms, more attributes(not very important)\cite{Erman:2006:TCU:1162678.1162679} may actually hurt the overall accuracy of the classification. So, determining the best combination of attributes and also combination of them helps in actually improving overall accuracy. We developed our own technique, where we used multiple trained models to classifying the incoming flow.

\section{Related Work}


\section{Dataset and Cleaning}
We used dataset provided by Sysmate. Dataset is 100GB of captured data with full payload. Dataset has been captured for isolated applications. We considered 5 applications for our study i.e. Skype, Http, Edonkey, Bittorrent, Gnutella. Used python scapy library to extract packet information from pcap files to built flows. Considered L7 signatures\ref{} to remove any discrepancies in the data by matching regular expressions provided by L7 with the payload for protocols. Used python to generate flow statistics for flow. 

\section{Importance of attributes in classification}
We have considered a total of 18 flow statistics for our studies.
\addvbuffer[12pt 8pt]{\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
	\hline  Average IAT & Maximum of IAT \\ 
	\hline  Minimum of IAT & Stadard Deviation of IAT\\ 
	\hline  Average RIAT & Maximum of RIAT\\ 
	\hline  Minimum of RIAT& Standard Deviation of RIAT\\
	\hline  Average Packet Size & Minimum of Packet Size \\  
	\hline  Maximum of Packet Size & Standard Deviation of Packet Size \\ 
	\hline  Total Packet Size& Flow Duration\\
	\hline  Number of Packets & Average Packets/second\\
	\hline  Average Bytes/second & Payload Size \\ 
	\hline 
\end{tabular}}
We observe from fig.\ref{fig_flow} that combination of Total packet size and Payload size leads to better accuracy along with combination of Number of Packets and Payload size. From fig.\ref{fig_iat} and fig.\ref{fig_riat}, we observe the accuracy is very low. fig.\ref{fig_pkt_size} we observe that combination of Average, Minimum and Maximum packet size and also combination of Average and Standard deviation of packet size leads to better accuracy. Observing the tables we see accuracy is not at its best when we use all the attributes than when we use subset of them.

\section{Population Fraction}
In this paper, we introduced new term called population fraction, which stands for percentage of dominant application (application with most number of flows in the cluster in consideration.) flows to total flows in a cluster
\begin{equation}
P_{clus} = \frac{flows_{dominant}}{flows_{total}}
\end{equation}
\section{Multiple cluster models used for classification}
We built four cluster models (used simplest K-Means clustering algorithm) to build the classifier, selecting 2 combinations of attributes from flow attributes, and two combinations of attributes from Packet size attributes. We haven't considered IAT and RIAT in building cluster models as any combination of attributes is not giving higher accuracy. By considering combinations of subset of attributes rather than whole set, as they did in \cite{} we get better accuracy.

Our technique, considers results from all the models in determining the final classification result. We considered six different hypothesis in determining the final classification result from the results from four different models.

\textbf{Considered hypothesis}:
\begin{description}
	\item[\textbf{Random}]\hfill \\ Select classification of any of the results from the four models as the final classification result
	\item[\textbf{Greatest}]\hfill \\ Select classification result from model with highest population fraction as the final classification result
	\item[\textbf{Quorum}]\hfill \\ Select the majority result from trained models. If we have 3 models resulted in one classification result and other resulted in other application then we consider result of 3 as the final classification result. In case of tie we select application randomly
	\item[\textbf{Unanimous}]\hfill \\ Select the final classification only when all the results from the four models exactly results in the same result. Otherwise mark it as unknown
	\item[\textbf{Unanimous Greatest}]\hfill \\ Similar to unanimous but fallback hypothesis is greatest.
	\item[\textbf{Unanimous Random}]\hfill \\ Similar to unanimous but fallback hypothesis is random
	\item[\textbf{Unanimous Quorum}]\hfill \\ Unanimous with fallback hypothesis as Quorum
\end{description}

	\caption{Number of Clusters v/s Accuracy}
	\label{fig_hypo_models}
\end{figure*}
In fig.\ref{fig_hypo_models} Observing the results in the \ref{fig_hypo_models} we can observe that better accuracies are observed for greatest, unanimous greatest and quorum. Accuracy increases with number of clusters for all the hypotheses, but sharp rise in accuracy with number of clusters for unanimous greatest. Out of them we observe the best accuracy for unanimous greatest with 40 clusters.

\section{Results}

	\caption{Percent of training data v/s Accuracy}
	\label{fig_hypo_accu_percent}
\end{figure*}
We compared our results with supervised, basic K-Means clustering algorithms. Fig.\ref{fig_hypo_accu_percent} shows the result of various algorithms plotted against percent of training data used. In the fig.\ref{fig_hypo_accu_percent} K-Means selected shows the accuracy of basic K-Means algorithm(we considered 40 clusters for all unsupervised algorithms in this figure) plotted when only considered the combination of attributes which is giving best accuracy(we considered all the attributes which were giving better accuracy, but different combination of subsets in our technique). All the plots follow similar kind of pattern, where accuracy increasing along with percentage of training data. Our technique gives better accuracy when compared with simple K-Means clustering almost all the time and also comparatively better accuracy than Adaboost (supervised machine learning algorithm) at some points and at other points it gives around same accuracy as supervised.

% Note that IEEE does not put floats in the very first column - or typically
% anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also, in-text middle ("here")
% positioning is not used. Most IEEE journals/conferences use top floats
% exclusively. Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the \fnbelowfloat
% command of the stfloats package.



\section{Conclusion}
By considering all the attributes of flow in classifying the application doesn't give better results. Selected attributes with combinations gives better accuracy. Accuracy doesn't continually increases along with number of clusters, as we get better accuracy when we are around 40 clusters. 

Considering IAT and RIAT for classification gives us the least accuracy when compared with other attributes of the flow. Even considering all attributes of packet size and flow also doesn't give better accuracy. 

Population fraction will be very good parameter in classification of flow using clustering techniques.
